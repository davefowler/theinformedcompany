<a name="about"></a>

As of writing this, most comprehensive books on analytics architecture that we’ve found are over a decade old, most of them pre-cloud. Because there really isn’t a modern equivalent to Kimball’s seminal The Data Warehouse Toolkit, today’s data teams still have to reinvent for themselves the principles of building a data stack, and too often, they do this without guidance. We wanted to solve this problem. We wanted to create a best-practices type guide for bootstrapping and nurturing a technologically-current data warehouse.

#### Who this book is for

We wrote this book for whoever values data and believes that informed companies are competitive. It’s a book for the working professional creating a practical, modern data stack. It’s for the lone analyst or the professional embedded in a team. It’s for anyone interested in what design practices underlie robust data architecture, the kind that equips entire companies with business intelligence insights. At its heart, this book is written with collaboration in mind.

    <b>Dave Fowler</b> has worked in BI for years, and has always looked for ways to JOIN teams ON data. He wants to enable any working professional (not just data analysts) to explore and understand their data. As the founder and CEO of Chartio, Dave has spent the last decade leading the development of a self-service BI product that aims to do just that. Chartio’s suite of tools made it easy for anyone at a data-driven business to browse their schemas, merge various data sources, and produce beautiful dashboards. Chartio has since been acquired by Atlassian.
