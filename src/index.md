<a name="about"></a>

Huge demand and technology shifts have dramatically changed the best practices of how to work with data, and yet no new books have come forward to establish these practices keeping many following old patterns and books who's best practices are now often bad practice.  

This was the problem the authors Dave Fowler (CEO of [Chartio](https://chartio.com) - now acquired by Atlassian) and Matt David ( Head of [The Data School](https://dataschool.com)) faced over a decade of working with thousands of customers struggling to turn their huge datasets into a needed source of truth and insight.  

They began organizing and writing on the stages, pitfalls and best practices of setting up a modern data stack so that companies and their knowledge workers can well utilize their data and become a winning *Informed Company*.  Initial versions of this were shared on [dataschool.com](https://dataschool.com) and they have now put considerable more work into formalizing these stages and practices for this print edition.

    <b>Dave Fowler</b> has worked in BI for years, and has always looked for ways to JOIN teams ON data. He wants to enable any working professional (not just data analysts) to explore and understand their data. As the founder and CEO of Chartio, Dave has spent the last decade leading the development of a self-service BI product that aims to do just that. Chartio’s suite of tools made it easy for anyone at a data-driven business to browse their schemas, merge various data sources, and produce beautiful dashboards. Chartio has since been acquired by Atlassian.
